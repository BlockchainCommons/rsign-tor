# rsign2

A simple rust implementation of [Minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) tool.

All signatures produced by rsign can be verified with minisign including trusted comments. Minisign is able to sign files with keys generated by rsign.

In Rust, signatures can also be verified with the [minisign-verify](https://docs.rs/minisign-verify) crate.

rsign2 is a maintained fork of [rsign](https://docs.rs/crate/rsign/), originally written by Daniel Rangel.

## Usage

```sh
rsign generate
```

Generates a new key pair. The public key is printed in the screen and stored in `rsign.pub` by default. The secret key will be written at `~/.rsign/rsign.key`. You can change the default paths with `-p` and `-s` respectively.

```sh
rsign sign myfile.txt
```

Sign `myfile.txt` with your secret key. You can add a signed trusted comment with:

```sh
rsign sign myfile.txt -t "my trusted comment"
```

If you are signing files larger than 1Gb you must use `-H` to first hash the file and sign the hash after that:

```sh
rsign sign mylargefile.bin -H
```

And to verify the signature with a given public key you can use:

```sh
rsign verify myfile.txt -p rsign.pub
```

Or if you have saved the signature file with a custom name other than `myfile.txt.rsign` and want to use a public key string you can use:

```sh
rsign verify myfile.txt -P [PUBLIC KEY STRING] -x mysignature.file
```

You can find more information using the help subcommand as in:

```text
    $ rsign help [SUBCOMMAND]

    USAGE:
        rsign [SUBCOMMAND]
